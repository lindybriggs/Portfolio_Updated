# Lindy Briggs Portfolio - HW 2 & 7

## Description

For this homework assignment, I accomplished the following:

* Created an html web page with my name, a photo of myself, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me.

* When clicked, links in the header/navigation scroll the UI to the correponding section.

* The section about my work has titled image of my applications, with the first image being larger than the others. Clicking the images opens a new tab to that deployed application. Clicking 'GitHub' in the item title bubble takes users to that GitHub Repo.

* A contact section provides links to email me, my LinkedIn account, and my GitHub page.

* When users resize their page, the site dynamically adapts to that given viewport.

* Created a repo on github and added a README file, css stylesheet, html file, and other necessary files like images, etc.

* Sucessfully pushed commits to this github repo with detailed messages.
