## Description

Created an html web page with my name, a photo of myself, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me.When clicked, links in the header/navigation scroll the UI to the correponding section. The section about my work has titled images of my applications, with the first image being larger than the others. Clicking the images opens a new tab to that deployed application. Clicking 'GitHub' in the item title bubble takes users to that GitHub Repo. A contact section provides links to email me, my LinkedIn account, and my GitHub page. When users resize their page, the site dynamically adapts to that given viewport. Created a repo on github and added a README file, css stylesheet, html file, and other necessary files like images, etc. Sucessfully pushed commits to this github repo with detailed messages.
